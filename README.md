# 3 homeworkPassword

The purpose of this homework was to create a password generator using JavaScript. There had to be a character limit between 8 and 128 characters, along with choices to have special characters, numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. And depending on what is chosen by the user, it'll generate a password for them.


## Prerequisites

```
Used Visual Studio Code and chrome's inspector tool to help build and rework code. HTML/CSS was already created. Along with the Event Listener.
```

## Process/What was Changed

```
I had to setup a plan and figure out what I needed to have as variables. Once those were defined, I started with my prompt, when the user click "generate password". 

It will ask how many characters they wish to have with the set parameters. If they are outside of 8-128 characters. It'll give them an error and require them to start over with hitting "generate password". Once character limit is defined, it'll provide a series of alerts confirming the special characters, upper and lowercase  parameters. I noticed that I needed to add a if statement if the user didn't add any parameters so it would give them another error. But if they were to choose certain parameters, it would take them and then use a loop and Math Random and Math Floor with the passwordCharacters to generate their password.

## Review

```
This was a challenge for me since I had a hard time figuring out where to start. I was very much overwhelmed on how to deal with the code since there was so much that needed to be done and thoughts would come up as I tried to write my first lines of code. Luckily, I have a good friend who is already a web developer. She helped in understanding the concepts that I learned in class and then I was able get going. She taught me abit about ES6 and shortening my code to make it cleaner so I went ahead and included that so I can implement a bit of what I had learned from her. My tutor noticed this and he said that she is a good friend because knowing this will help me later on in the bootcamp.
